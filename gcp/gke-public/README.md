This structure is to reuse the VPC and GKE modules across different environments (like dev, stage, and prod), while keeping the specific values for each environment (like region, cluster name, etc.) in the environment directories (dev, stage, prod).

Breakdown:
1. VPC and GKE modules are reusable:
- These modules define how to create the infrastructure generically.
- They donâ€™t contain hardcoded values for things like VPC names, cluster names, or regions. Instead, they use variables.

2. Environment-specific directories (e.g., dev, stage, prod) hold the environment-specific configurations:
- Each environment has its own main.tf where you use the reusable VPC and GKE modules by passing in specific values (like names, regions, counts).
- The terraform.tfvars files in each environment directory contain actual values that are specific to that environment. 

3. Variables in the modules (VPC, GKE) are passed from each environment:
- The VPC and GKE modules declare variables (variables.tf) that will receive values from the calling environment (dev, stage, prod).
- These values are provided in the terraform.tfvars files within each environment directory or directly in the environment-specific main.tf.
